  abstract = {Whisker movement has been shown to be under active control in certain specialist animals such as rats and mice. Though this whisker movement is well characterized, the role and effect of this movement on subsequent sensing is poorly understood. One method for investigating this phenomena is to generate artificial whisker deflections with robotic hardware under different movement conditions. A limitation of this approach is that assumptions must be made in the design of any artificial whisker actuators, which will impose certain restrictions on the whisker-object interaction. In this paper we present three robotic whisker platforms, each with different mechanical whisker properties and actuation mechanisms. A feature-based classifier is used to simultaneously discriminate radial distance to contact and contact speed for the first time. We show that whisker-object contact speed predictably affects deflection magnitudes, invariant of whisker material or whisker movement trajectory. We propose that rodent whisker control allows the animal to improve sensing accuracy by regulating contact speed induced touch-to-touch variability.},

  abstract = {This is a novel investigation on the possibility of detecting barely visible impact damage (BVID) in composite materials by whisking across the surface via tactile whisker sensors that resemble rats' whiskers. A series of drop tower low-velocity impact tests were performed on quasi-isotropic composite plates. The plates were made from unidirectional T800 carbon/MTM49-3 epoxy prepregs with the stacking sequence of [45/0/90/-45]4S. Investigating the specimens' surface by the naked eye does not reveal any significant damage, rather than a small dent on the surface, with no tangible difference in the different impact energy levels. Ultrasonic C-scan observations showed the existence of BVID in all the impact energy levels, with an increasing trend in the damage size by increasing the impact energy level. The collected data from whisker sensors were analyzed using the support vector machine classifier, based on their vibrational properties, to identify the impacted region and classify the impact severity. It was observed that after training for 13 whisker contacts, the BVID severity can be classified with an accuracy of 100\%. This is offering a new BVID detection technique, with a high potential for automation and high reliability that can be used as an alternative or combined with available inspection systems.},

Biomimetic active perception is formulated from three principles: (i) evidence accumulation based on leading models of perceptual decision making; (ii) action selection with an evidence-based policy, here based on overt focal attention; and (iii) sensory encoding of evidence based on neural coding. Two experiments with each of three biomimetic tactile sensors are considered: the iCub (capacitive) fingertip, the TacTip (optical) tactile sensor, and BIOTACT whiskers. For each sensor, one experiment considers a similar task (perception of shape and location) and the other a different tactile perception task. In all experiments, active perception with a biomimetic action selection policy based on focal attention outperforms passive perception with static or random action selection. The active perception also consistently reaches superresolved accuracy (hyperacuity) finer than the spacing between tactile elements. Biomimetic active touch thus offers a common approach for biomimetic tactile sensors to accurately and robustly characterize and explore non-trivial, uncertain environments analogous to how animals perceive the natural world.},

A biomimetic robot (SCRATCHbot) inspired by the rat whisker system was here used to examine the performance of a novelty detection algorithm based on a ``naive'' implementation of Bayes rule. Naive Bayes algorithms are known to be both efficient and effective, and also have links with proposed neural mechanisms for decision making. To examine novelty detection, the robot first used its whiskers to sense an empty floor, after which it was tested with a textured strip placed in its path. Given only its experience of the familiar situation, the robot was able to distinguish the novel event and localize it in time. Performance increased with the number of whiskers, indicating benefits from integrating over multiple streams of information. Considering the generality of the algorithm, we suggest that such novelty detection could have widespread applicability as a trigger to react to important features in the robot's environment.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have been inspired by natural whiskers for a proposal of tactile sensing system to augment the sensory ability of autonomous robots. In this study, we propose a novel artificial soft whisker sensor that is not only flexible but also adapts and compensates for being trimmed or broken during operation. In this morphological compensation designed from an analytical model of the whisker, our sensing device actively adjusts its morphology to regain sensitivity close to that of its original form (before being broken). To serve this purpose, the body of the whisker comprises a silicon-rubber truncated cone with an air chamber inside as the medulla layer, which is inflated to achieve rigidity. A small strain gauge is attached to the outer wall of the chamber for recording strain variation upon contact of the whisker. The chamber wall is reinforced by two inextensible nylon fibers wound around it to ensure that morphology change occurs only in the measuring direction of the strain gauge by compressing or releasing pressurized air contained in the chamber. We investigated an analytical model for the regulation of whisker sensitivity by changing the chamber morphology. Experimental results showed good agreement with the numerical results of performance by an intact whisker in normal mode, as well as in compensation mode. Finally, adaptive functionality was tested in two separate scenarios for thorough evaluation: (1) A short whisker (65\,mm) compensating for a longer one (70\,mm), combined with a special case (self-compensation), and (2) vice versa. Preliminary results showed good feasibility of the idea and efficiency of the analytical model in the compensation process, in which the compensator in the typical scenario performed with 20.385\% average compensation error. Implementation of the concept in the present study fulfills the concept of morphological computation in soft robotics and paves the way toward accomplishment of an active sensing system that overcomes a critical event (broken whisker) based on optimized morphological compensation.},

This not only allows the robot to perform natural interactions with the environment whilst navigating, as is normally seen in nature, but also provides a mechanism to fuse non-unique tactile and unique visual data.

The ``BIOTACT Sensor'' consists of a conical array of modular, actuated hair-like elements, each instrumented at the base to accurately detect deflections of the shaft by whisker-surface contacts. A notable characteristic of this array is that, like the biological sensory system it mimics, the whiskers are moved back-and-forth (``whisked'') so as to make repeated, brief contacts with surfaces of interest. Furthermore, these movements are feedback-modulated in a manner intended to emulate some of the ``active sensing'' control strategies observed in whiskered animals. We show that accurate classification of surface texture using data obtained from whisking against three different surfaces is achievable using classifiers based on either naive Bayes or template methods. Notably, the performance of both these approaches to classify textures after training on as few as one or two surface contacts was improved when the whisking motion was controlled using a sensory feedback mechanism. We conclude that active vibrissal sensing could likewise be a useful sensory capacity for autonomous robots.},

However, the original photometric error is only defined for points. It seems difficult to extend it to lines. In previous works, the collinear constraints for points on lines are either ignored [1] or introduce heavy computational load into the resulting optimization system [2]. This paper extends the photometric error for lines. We prove that the 3D points of the points on a 2D line are determined by the inverse depths of the endpoints of the 2D line, and derive a closed-form solution for this problem. This property can significantly reduce the number of variables to speed up the optimization, and can make the collinear constraint exactly satisfied. Furthermore, we introduce a twostep method to further accelerate the optimization, and prove the convergence of this method. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art direct VO algorithms.},

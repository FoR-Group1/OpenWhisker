We are currently using a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi camera which pushes the camera to a simple websocket with [pi-h264-to-browser](https://github.com/dans98/pi-h264-to-browser), then we can read this camera feed easily on another laptop easily with something like [ros2_ipcamera](https://github.com/surfertas/ros2_ipcamera). We will see in time if the resolution/framerate is good enough.

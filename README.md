Whisker sensors have been an active area of research in recent years for their interesting use-cases in robotics and mammal physiology research.
Several attempts have been made to develop open-source versions of the sensor to promote wider adoption.
However, the existing calibration processes for whisker sensors are highly proprietary, cost-prohibitive and error-prone.
In this project, we open source a low-cost open-source calibration and testing platform based on an off-the-shelf 3D printer.

Please see the following documentation for full instructions on how to build and run.

## Assembly Instructions

1. Printing the

   - End Effector Mount
   - Whisker Sensor Adaptor
   - End Effector Mount

2. Attach the Whisker Sensor Adaptor to rear end of the printer base (optinally use a sheed to rubber between the adaptor and the printer base for increased resistance and protection from the screws)

3. Attachment of the End Effector Mount and Beam - Remove the screws from the extruder motor - Attach the End Effector Mount - Screw it back in - Place the Ruler into the slot
